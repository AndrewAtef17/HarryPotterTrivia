       With a lion as its crest and Professor McGonagall at its head, Gryffindor is the house which most values the virtues of courage, bravery and determination
     </div>
     <p>
       Gryffindor House places high value on traits such as courage, chivalry, and nerve. During Harrys time at Hogwarts, the head of Gryffindor House was Minerva McGonagall. The entrance to the Gryffindor common room is located behind a large painting of a Fat Lady in a pink silk dress. If you know the right password to tell her, she swings open to reveal a round opening in the wall. The common room contains a lot of squashy armchairs, a fireplace, and tables. The fireplace is connected to the Floo Network, but as it is extremely public except in the dead of night, Gryffindors usually use owls to communicate with their families instead. There's also a notice board, for public announcements such as the date of the next Hogsmeade weekend, but also for notices from individual students seeking to buy or sell secondhand books, or trade Chocolate Frog cards, or similar, as in any school. The Gryffindor team won the Quidditch Cup during the 1993 - 1994 season - the first time since 1984 - and again during the 1995 - 1996 season. They wear robes of scarlet. For each known Gryffindor below, his or her name is given together with the years he or she was a student in Gryffindor. See the individual students' entries for more information

       Ravenclaws prize wit, learning, and wisdom. It's an ethos etched into founder Rowena Ravenclaw's diadem: 'wit beyond measure is man's greatest treasure
     </div>
     <p>
      Many Ravenclaws tend to be academically motivated and talented students. They also pride themselves in being original in their ideas, and methods. It's not unusual to find Ravenclaw students practising especially different types of magic that other houses might shun. Often hard-working and diligent, as often is the case with intellectuals with a predisposition for academics, some of the pupils sorted under the blue-bronzed eagle are known to be inclined to dismiss certain social expectation for the sake of satisfying their own intellectual curiosity. Some of these eventually also ended up being not only accepted, but even celebrated, in spite of being initially subjected to scorn for their various oddities.Ravenclaws tend to be curious about the world and pay attention to the world around them. Ravenclaws are known to be logical and rational. In addition, Ravenclaw students tend to have abilities regarding Memory. Ravenclaw members are known with their different ideas and original methods. Especially creating different, unimaginable spells and discovering new techniques are known as the house characteristics.

     <div class="quotes" style="color:rgb(190, 160, 5)">
       Hufflepuffs value hard work, patience, loyalty, and fair play. The house has produced its share of great wizards not least Newt Scamander, author of Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them
     </div>
     <p>
      Hufflepuff is the most underrated house at Hogwarts. Hufflepuff has the fewest Dark wizards of any house at Hogwarts which we take to mean that they act decently when confronted with difficult circumstances. Hufflepuff alumni dont get nearly enough credit. The house has quietly produced some very talented witches and wizards over the years, though these individuals are often overlooked or underappreciated. A true Puff possesses a deep love for their family, friends, and all living things. They are selfless and gentle, tolerant and kind. Subjects involving plants or animals appeal to Hufflepuff students, and these students tend to have an affinity for Earthy, elemental magic. You just know Hufflepuff is growing the dankest.. mandrakes. Since those dark days, Hufflepuff has become the hottest house of all. They embody the most admirable qualities and never seek praise, practicing humility at every turn. Patient, compassionate, and loyal, Hufflepuffs make great leaders and even better friends.

       Slytherin produces more than its share of Dark wizards, but also turns out leaders who are proud, ambitious and cunning. Merlin is one particularly famous Slytherin
     </div>

      As a house, Slytherin does not have the best reputation yes, we know every one of Voldemort friends was in Slytherin and, okay, their founder hid a monstrous Basilisk in the underground chamber of a school, of all things but that doesnt mean they are all bad. On the contrary, as potential partners Slytherins have quite a lot to offer.. Although some Slytherins chose to channel their ambition in some very questionable directions, it is certainly not bad to be ambitious, unless you are doing dastardly things to achieve those ambitions. And in some cases, that did happen: take Lord Voldemort to murder and torture Muggles and Muggle-borns. But, usually, ambition is a good quality many Slytherins are possessed of a drive to succeed, and this motivates them to greater feats. As the partner of a Slytherin, you could probably help them channel this ambition in more appropriate ways. Say, excelling in a chosen career rather than excelling in bloodshed. This ambition and drive makes Slytherins pretty single-minded in their pursuits after all, Draco Malfoy decision to accept Voldemort mission in Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince was largely motivated by a desire to prevent his family from suffering and Snape is dangerous life as a double-agent was driven by his love for Harry mother.
